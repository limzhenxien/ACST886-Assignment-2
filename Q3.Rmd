Question 3
Part A
We first input the data into vectors. 
```{r}
age=c(70:75)
ecx=c(1000,1500,1010,1008,1006,998)
dx=c(80,90,95,105,115,125)
```
Then we create a function with two parameters to be estimated and use nlm function to obtain the esitmates. The negative of maximum likelihood function is maximized, which gives us the minimized estimation. But first, we use the lm() function to calculate the initial estimates. 
```{r}
crude=dx/ecx
logcrude=log(crude)
lm(logcrude~age)
a=exp(-8.67325)
b=exp(0.08788)
f=function(theta){
  -(sum(-ecx*theta[1]*theta[2]^age+dx*log(ecx*theta[1]*theta[2]^age)-log(factorial(dx))))
}
nlm(f,p=c(a,b))
```
Part B
Repeating the same steps as in Part A using nlm function. 
```{r}
age2=c(30:49)
ex2=c(70000,66672,68375,65420,61779,66091,68514,69560,65000,66279,67300,65368,65391,62917,66537,62320,62145,63856,61907,61110)
dx2=c(39,43,34,31,23,50,48,43,48,47,62,63,84,86,120,121,122,162,151,184)
crude2=dx2/ex2
rate2=log(crude2/(1-crude2))
lm(log(crude2)~age2)
c=exp(-10.85317)
d=exp(0.09998)
f2=function(theta2){
  -(sum(ex2*(crude2-theta2[1]-theta2[2]*rate2)^2))
} 
nlm(f2,p=c(c,d)) 
```
Part C
Repeat the same steps as in Part A and B.
```{r}
age3=c(47:67)
ex3=c(166,187,218,243,276,302,347,390,430,494,558,628,701,813,917,1040,1182,1299,1432,1596,1752)
dx3=c(2,2,4,6,2,4,7,3,9,9,8,11,14,18,18,24,30,43,41,54,64)
stdtableqx=c(0.00505,0.0057,0.00644,0.00728,0.00826,0.0093,0.01051,0.01184,0.01331,0.01492,0.01668,0.01859,0.02065,0.02287,0.02525,0.02778,0.03049,0.03339,0.03648,0.03978,0.04332)
crude3=dx3/ex3
lm(log(crude3)~age3)
e=exp(-6.96358)
f=exp(0.05233)
f3=function(theta3){
  -(sum(ex3*(crude3-theta3[1]-theta3[2]*stdtableqx)^2))
}
nlm(f3,p=c(e,f))
```
